CMSC100 - UV1L

Regarding my expectations for CMSC100, I think this course will be enjoyable since web development is the field that I am most interested with and have the most experience with. Having passed CMSC128, I have some experiences with designing the frontend of a website, but not the backend.


Psymon Sez Arcedera : Agreement
I definitely agree that web development is a very interesting field and somewhat enjoyable. I also have a minimal experience with designing websites but by taking CMSC 100, I also expect that I would have more in depth knowledge about it.
